= job-dsl-sample

Sample project for a Jenkins Job DSL setup with Gradle.

* Uses Jenkins Test Harness to test the DSL on a real Jenkins
* Includes a Jenkinsfile for use in a multi-branch pipeline job

== Testing Job DSL

----
$ ./gradlew test
----

This starts up Jenkins using Jenkins Test Harness and runs the Job DSL scripts in the `jobs` directory. A very simple
Spock test checks that no exception is thrown. Real world setup might want to use some more advanced tests, but this
gives you a starting point for an initial setup. Additionally, the generated job config files are saved to the directory
`build/xml`.
